# Basic Manual Control with Tello Mobile Application

The Tello mobile application allows you to control your Tello EDU drone manually using your smartphone or tablet. This provides a hands-on experience for piloting the drone, making it an excellent starting point before delving into more advanced programming and autonomous flying. Here's a basic guide to manual control using the Tello mobile app:


1. **Download and Setup**:
   - Download the "Tello" app from the App Store (iOS) or Google Play Store (Android) and install it on your mobile device.
     - App Store : https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tello/id1330559633
     - Google Play Store : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ryzerobotics.tello&hl=en&gl=US
   - Ensure your Tello EDU drone is fully charged and powered on.
   - Connect your mobile device to the drone's Wi-Fi network, which is typically named something like "TELLO-XXXXXX".

3. **Basic Controls**:
   - On the app's interface, you'll find virtual control sticks that mimic the controls of a physical remote:
     - **Left Stick**: Controls altitude (up and down) and rotation (yaw) of the drone.
     - **Right Stick**: Controls forward/backward movement (pitch) and side-to-side movement (roll).

4. **Taking Off and Landing**:
   - To take off, gently push the left stick upwards until the drone hovers at a safe altitude. The drone will stabilize itself.
   - To land, gently push the left stick downwards until the drone safely lands on the ground.

5. **Hovering and Stabilizing**:
   - To keep the drone in a stable hover, release both sticks. The drone should maintain its current position.

6. **Movement**:
   - Use the right stick to control the drone's movement. Pushing the stick forward will make the drone move forward, pulling it back will make it move backward, and so on.
   - Use the left stick to control altitude and rotation. Pushing the stick forward will make the drone descend, pulling it back will make it ascend, pushing it to the left or right will make the drone rotate in that direction.

7. **Emergency Stop**:
   - If you encounter any issues or need to stop the drone immediately, you can tap the "Emergency Stop" button on the app. This will halt the drone's motors and bring it to a quick stop.

8. **Recording Media**:
   - The Tello app allows you to capture photos and record videos using the drone's camera. You'll find buttons on the app's interface for these functions.

9. **Settings and More**:
   - The app may have additional features such as flight modes, gesture controls, and camera settings. Explore the app's menu to access these options.

Remember that manual piloting takes practice to become proficient. Start in an open and safe area, preferably outdoors with minimal wind, to avoid obstacles and ensure a safe flying experience. As you become more comfortable with manual control, you can explore more advanced features and programming options that the Tello EDU offers.
