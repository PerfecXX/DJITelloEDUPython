# Library Installation 

Before coding with Python, we first need to install the library.

### Install with PIP

```python
pip install djitellopy
```

### Install with Package Manager 

If you are using Thonny IDE, you can use Package Manager within the IDE.

Tools > Manage Packages

Then search for **djitellopy** and install or upgrade it on your client computer.

### Testing 

If the library is already installed or updated, try to import it into your code.

If it does not show any error, then you are ready to go.

```python
from djitellopy import Tello,TelloSwarm
```
