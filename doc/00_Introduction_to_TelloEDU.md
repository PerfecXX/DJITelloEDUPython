Key features of the Tello EDU include:

1. **Programmability**: One of the standout features of the Tello EDU is its ability to be programmed using various programming languages and platforms. Users can code the drone to perform specific tasks, maneuvers, and flights, enhancing their understanding of coding and robotics principles.

2. **Scratch Programming**: The Tello EDU supports Scratch, a visual programming language developed by MIT. This makes it easy for beginners, especially young learners, to create simple programs by dragging and dropping blocks of code, which are then translated into drone actions.

3. **SDK Support**: The Tello EDU offers a Software Development Kit (SDK) that allows more advanced users to create custom applications for controlling the drone. This opens up possibilities for complex tasks, simulations, and integrations.

4. **Swarm Capabilities**: Tello EDU drones can communicate with each other, enabling users to create swarm formations and coordinated flights. This feature can teach concepts of swarm robotics and collaboration.

5. **Sensors and Flight Modes**: The Tello EDU is equipped with sensors for stability and obstacle detection, which are essential for safe indoor flights. It also supports different flight modes, such as flips and tricks, adding an element of fun to the learning process.

6. **Camera and Imaging**: The onboard camera allows users to capture photos and videos from the drone's perspective. This can be particularly useful for projects involving visual data collection and analysis.

7. **Educational Resources**: Ryze Tech provides a range of educational resources, tutorials, and lesson plans that educators can use to incorporate the Tello EDU into their curriculum. This helps bridge the gap between technology and education.

8. **Safe and Lightweight**: The Tello EDU is designed with safety in mind, making it suitable for indoor use. Its lightweight build minimizes the risk of damage to both the drone and its surroundings.
